# Stock-Analysis
## VBA Macros Overview
In this analysis we wanted to follow the trends of the stocks. The dataset was pretty big. Since our data came in an excel sheet, we had an oppurtuinty to use VBA macros to make our jobs a little easier. In excel, we could have just repeatedly typed our formualas into the cells and eventually received the same nummbers we had after running our macros. However, that would have taken quite a bit of time. As well as, would've been difficult to keep up with what we were doing if we did not form all of our data in one day. Our goal was to show which stocks were safer to pick. To show which ones had a positive trend going betweenn to years.
